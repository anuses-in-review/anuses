<h1>Main Code Ideas</h1>

<h3>Visualizations</h3>

<ul>
    <li><by>GendW Plot:</by> Bar graph with rolling average for <r>GendW</r> variable at Anus level.</li>
    <li><by>All-Time Plots:</by> All-time stacked bar graphs for <r>gend</r> and <r>skin</r> variables. Serves as simple overview?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Python Required</h3>

<ul>
    <li><by>Regression Model:</by> Interactive Python thingy that allows variable input into existing regression from <r>Main_Code</r> (make that too lol): PlaysN = Order + Season + Year + TimeOnAnus + Language + Genre + Duration + error</li>
</ul>

<h3>Involves Looking at Hella Chunks</h3>

<ul>
    <li><by>File Descriptions:</by> Create an ongoing html file that can be added to in each file. Each file add something like... "<r>FileName</r> creates <r>ListOfObjects</r>" with an unordered list that provides what the columns are as well.</li>
    <li><by>Chunk Organization:</by> Basically, just figure out the order the chunks need to run in.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New File</h3>

<ul>
    <li><by>data_actv and TimeOnAnus:</by> Create <r>TimeOnAnus</r> measure.</li>
    <li><by>table_strk:</by> Figure out everyone's highest streaks and make a table. Maybe include which Anuses they're included on and their total Appearances (already calculated).</li>
</ul>
